            <h4 style="color: darkturquoise">Butler's house 8:00AM</h4>
            <h4>*alarm sounds* I woke up frightened because I looked at the clock and saw it was 8:00AM. It was way over my allowed time to walk to school. Man I'm going to be so late...</h4>
            <h4>Full speed, 5 tasks at once, and in about 5 minutes I'm out the door. Freezing cold and way too tired to run but, I've gotta run so I wont get punished for being seriously too late to class.</h4>
            <h4>I've gone full usain bolt from my house to the school and that run made me super exhausted. All out of breath, tired and late to school. If anything else bad happens I feel like im going to break.</h4>
            <hr id=chaphr>
            <h4 style="color: darkcyan">Outside campus 8:55AM</h4>
            <h4>A long 30 minute run and I've made it to the campus outside the school and ther crossing guard there yelled out "A bit late arent we?" I gave him a smug look and crossed the road onto the campus field.</h4>
            <h4>Since I'm late I've gotta goto the office and get a late slip and serve some kind of detention determined by the "Wheel of Detention". Still exhausted and my legs were going to give out any moment.</h4>
            <hr id=chaphr>
            <h4 style="color: firebrick">Front office 9:00AM</h4>
            <h4>I've arrived inside of the school and headed straight into the front office. Stumbling on the door. One of my legs gave out and I fell to the floor. 
                Everyone was looking at me and the front desk lady felt a bit sad for me.</h4>
            <h4>The lady looked at me with a bit of a sad face and said "My god what happened to you?", I replied with, "I didn't have a ride so I ran down here...", she replied with "Umm.. Here, I'll give you this."</h4>
            <h4>It was a fake counselor slip and she didn't mark me late. A real blessing believe it or not... I had a little trouble getting up but I managed and went off to my classroom.</h4>
            <hr id=chaphr>
            <h4 style="color: dodgerblue">Hallway B 9:30AM</h4>
            <h4>As I was limping down the halls to get to the classroom I noticed somethnig in the corner of my eyes... A group of kids that looked familiar just sitting on desks in the hallway.</h4>
            <h4>I tried to not notice them and kept walking to my classroom until one of them blurted out, "<font color="lightgray">Look! It's that loser again!</font>". 
                Things were going to get heated up so I hurried to the classroom</h4>
            <h4>It wasn't much longer when they started chasing after me with an angry look on their face. The classroom wasn't that far, only 5 more doors down the hall.</h4>
            <h4>I've managed to reach the classroom and slammed the door. Out of breath and looking down with a big sigh of relief. I turned around and everyone was looking at me with a confused look...</h4>
            <hr id=chaphr>
            <h4 style="color: darkolivegreen">Classroom #General 9:45AM</h4>
            <h4>I looked towards the teacher and pulled out my fake counselor slip and gave it to him. He looked at it and said, "Alright sit down. Class is ending in 15 minutes so get some notes from someone else".</h4>
            <h4>Soaked with sweat, I turned and looked at <font color="crimson">Konmei</font>, and asked if I can borrow his notes. He's looking at my eyes with a confused look and proceeded to hand me his notes.</h4>
            <h4>I thanked him and took a couple of pictures of his notes with my phone... *bell rings* As I got up my legs had given out and I passed out because of all of the blood rushing to my head.</h4>
