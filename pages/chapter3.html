            <h4>I was lucky enough to catch the last train back home before it left or else I'd be stuck here since I didn't have another way home. I noticed these other guys on the train...</h4>
            <h4>I think they goto our school since their uniforms are just like our school's uniforms... I felt like I didn't have much to lose by asking them anyway... So I went up to them and said.</h4>
            <h4>"
                <font color="brown">Hey, do you guys goto Enigma High?</font>", only one of them replied, "
                <font color="gold">Whats it to ya, punk ass.</font>", as scared as I was to his attitude I kept my resolve and continued to talk.</h4>
            <h4>"
                <font color="brown">Well... You guys have the same uniforms there and I was just curious. Sorry if I'm bothering you guys.. I'll go now.</font>", I walked away in a steadily but fast pace.</h4>
            <h4>But one of them yelled out, "
                <font color="lightgray">Hey! Get your bitch ass over here. We aint done with you yet.</font>", I started to sweat when I was turning around... They all have this look on their face.</h4>
            <h4>I kept thinking if they're going to beat me up right here... As I proceeded to walk towards them. The train was stopping at my stop and when those doors opened. I ran out as fast as I could...</h4>

            <hr id="chaphr">
            <h4 style="color: deeppink">Ainsun Park 7:55PM</h4>

            <h4>I'm all out of breath and I decided to take a break in Ainsun Park. There was a sign reading "Ainsun Park is closing soon and being rebuilt as a museum named #Enigma-Art."</h4>
            <h4>I sure am going to miss this park... This is where
                <font color="deepskyblue">Namwen</font> and I used to play alot when we were just kids. I was walking around the park to gain some good memories back...</h4>
            <h4>As it was getting more late in the night I started to walk back home...</h4>

            <hr id="chaphr">
            <h4 style="color: darkorange">Butlers home 8:15PM</h4>

            <h4>When I opened the door nobody was home... I went to the dinner table and saw a note reading, "Your dad and I are going to #Spice-Inc. Your dinner is in the fridge.❤️Mom</h4>
            <h4>Well they're going to be gone for a few days. Might as well learn how to cook for the time being. I watched some videos on how to cook and wrote down some recepies.</h4>
            <h4>I prepared breakfast and lunch for myself later on and stuck it in the fridge for tomorrow. After I've cleaned all the pans I went back upstairs and got on the computer.</h4>
            <h4>Then opened up my favorite gamboling game, Dice and Dice†LEGGENDARIA... Lately I havent been doing good in the game but I feel super lucky tonight. I looked at my profile.</h4>
            <h4>I only have about 50k spice from doing daily events and winnings. The economy changes according to how much spice people have. Sometimes it goes up and sometimes it goes down </h4>

            <h4 style="color: chartreuse">Gambol 573 10:45PM</h4>

            <h4>A full room of 10 people. An announcer and game master decided how many dice and what the payouts were for each game. The pot gets bigger overtime you play since It's a fixed price</h4>
            <h4>The announcer said all of the payout rates and minimun and maximum dice numbers. The game was ready to start... Everyone rolled a dice. If one person trumps everyone's number.</h4>
            <h4>He gets to be first roll and has the highest chance of winning as well... I rolled and rolled a perfect 100. Causing me to win the current pot and placing me in 1st place</h4>
            <h4>Everyone in chat was calling me a cheater since rolling 100's are super rare... There was a counter of how many 100's rolled and theres only been 20 so far since the game started.</h4>
            <h4>I was up 10k spice and I could cash out, but I had a lot of confidence and selected Dice†LEGGENDARIA. This was all or nothing. The payout for Dice†LEGGENDARIA is 0 - 100x as much as I have</h4>
            <h4>There have been only 5 perfect Dice†LEGGENDARIA rolls and I want to add one more to it. Hesitantly I moved the mouse to click roll. I closed my eyes, palms are sweaty, and after I clicked...</h4>
            <h4>The dice sounds were playing. A drumroll started to play... And then.... A big celebration ceremony tune plays... I've never been so happy in my life to have rolled a perfect Dice†LEGGENDARIA.</h4>
            <h4>The chat went wild and my total spice went up to 1 million after that one game. Cashed out and said what could only be said in this situation... "GGWP" and left.</h4>
