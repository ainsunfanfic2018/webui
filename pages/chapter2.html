            <h4 style="color: burlywood">#Matching Arcade 3:30PM</h4>
            
            <h4>I was the first to arrive at the arcade so I texted <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> on when are they going to come. They both said about 5 minutes, so I headed inside to get out from the cold.</h4>
            
            <h4>5 minutes later they arrive at the same time, and <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> said, 
                "<font color="limegreen">Hey, lets all go match on SDVX theres a new update song that I want to play</font>"</h4>
            
            <h4><font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> said, "<font color="skyblue">Oh you're on! I'm going to PUC that chart.</font>" 
                <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> was always trying to show off his skill on rhythm games but, I was never really good at them anyway.</h4>
            
            <h4><font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> were going at it hard but here I am, struggling on low difficulties while 
                I was looking at them play level 18's and 19's</h4>
            
            <h4>Then, <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> said, "<font color="skyblue">Maybe one day you'll be able to play like us.</font>", with a big smug face.</h4>
            
            <hr id=chaphr>
            <h4 style="color: cadetblue">Bowling ally 4:00PM</h4>
            
            <h4>We took a break from playing rhythm games and headed to the arcades' bowling ally. It was my first time bowling and I was nervous to go up and bowl the ball.</h4>
            
            <h4>So then <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> activated the gutter guard rails and <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> yelled, 
                "<font color="limegreen">I'll give you $20 if you hit your first strike dude!</font>", I looked back at him and he had a big smile on his face</h4>
            
            <h4>I told myself it was this moment I'll show the both of them my unknown talent. I stuck my tounge out my lip to the right side of my cheek and took form to bowl the bowling ball into the pins</h4>
            
            <h4>I let go of the bowling ball... It was dead center, heading straight for the pins, I thought to myself that this was the moment. That my unknown skill had risen from the depths of my soul.</h4>
            
            <h4>To show them both how great I am... Time was slowing down... The ball was still moving dead center... Everything has gone silent. And then... It veered off course and went straight into the gutter...</h4>
            
            <h4>Both of them were laughing as hard as they could. While im standing there with a dissapointed look and loss of confidence in my soul. I tried to act cool and tryied to walk it off.</h4>
            
            <h4>But <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> patted me on the back saying, <font color="skyblue">"Tough luck man..."</font></h4>
            
            <hr id=chaphr>
            <h4 style="color: forestgreen">Pool tables 5:30PM</h4>
            
            <h4>We all decided to play pool as our last game before we went home. <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> had brought the cue balls and chalk over while 
                <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> brought the pool cues.</h4>
            
            <h4>I was thinking to myself after the bowling inccident how I'll do in pool. <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> said, 
                "<font color="limegreen">Don't sweat it man, we're all here to have fun!</font>" He was a good hearted man and I respected him for that.</h4>
            
            <h4>We played rock, paper, scissors, to see who shall go first, second, and who sits down for the round. I'd won the game and I'm first to break. Right as I'm super focused...</h4>
            
            <h4><font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> showed up suddenly and asked if he could join in... The three of us agreed to do a 2v2 so <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> 
                was on my team and <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> were their own team.</h4>
            
            <h4><font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> claimed that he's super good at pool and that he's been coming to this place for about 3 years playing pool. 
                I don't believe him but some guy called out <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> for a rematch after he's done with us.</h4>
            
            <h4>After that had happened I've gained a little bit of faith in believing him. <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> went ahead and broke up the cueballs from their triangular shape.</h4>
            
            <h4>He got lucky and pocketed 4 solid balls. He gave the pool cue to me and said, "<font color="darkviolet">Have a go at it bro, I made it easier for ya.</font>", 
                as he tilted his head and smiled at me afterwards.</h4>
            
            <h4>I see a clear shot of the orange solid into the top right hole... <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> told me not to hit it too hard or else the cue ball will fly off the table</h4>
            
            <h4>I hit the cue ball with a medium amount of force and it was a solid hit on the ball causing the inertia of the cue ball to transfer to the orange solid. </h4>
            
            <h4>With the right amount of speed, the orange solid had went right into the hole. <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> patted me on the back saying, 
                "<font color="darkviolet">Nice shot dude!</font>", <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font> were suprised that I made it in too.</h4>
            
            <h4><font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> had made a mistake and pocketed the 8 ball in accedentally... 
                The both of them had laughed even harder than what happened at the bowling ally. Even I had let out a snicker.</h4>
            
            <h4><font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> walked away with a pitiful smile and full of shame... I went up to him and said to him 
                "<font color="brown">GGWP</font>"... He felt a little bit humorous and happy after that and laughed it off...</h4>
