        <h4>It was a cold winter morning dawning on Enigma High. Everyone has just come back from their holiday break. I think I can see my old friend,
            <font color="deepskyblue">Namwen</font> from a distance, walking into the school building...</h4>

        <h4>I think i see... Someone else by his side... I started to walk a little bit faster to get a closer look of who he's with. As i reached the front of the school building. Namwen and this other person was walking upstairs to the 2nd floor.</h4>

        <h4>I quickly followed them up and being sneaky like a ninja. They seem to be having quite a conversation while walking into the library... Maybe I can casually show up to meet him and his friend.</h4>

        <h4>I walked into the library looking around for Namwen and I've finally spotted him. As i walked toward him, he noticed me and said,

            <font color="deepskyblue">How's it going man! Did you have a good break?</font>"

        <h4>Once the late bell has rung, our homeroom teacher was coming in with someone. I think it's
            <font color="crimson">Konmei</font>
            since he's the only transfer student that I know of. Instead it was someone else with her... </h4>
        <h4>The teacher said, "Okay, young man introduce yourself to the classroom." 
            "<font color="limegreen">Hi everyone! My name is Dado and I'm looking forward to being friends with you all!</font>" He seemed like a nice guy.</h4>
        <h4>Once we got our break, I approched
            <font color="limegreen">Dado</font> and we really got along well. I asked him if he wanted to be my friend and he said, 
            "<font color="limegreen">Wow! a new friend already!? And it's my first day here!</font>"</h4>
        <h4>Before the break ended. We exchanged numbers and decided to meet up at a local arcade after school.</h4>

        <h4 style="color: darksalmon">Lunch 10:50AM</h4>

        <h4>I'm glad my mom always makes me lunchboxes so I don't get trampled in the lunchroom line. While I was on my phone and eating... Someone else has come to my table and sat down.</h4>
        <h4>He introduced himself to me and said his name was
            <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font>. He was an ok guy but, he asked if he wanted to be my friend. So i said, 
            "<font color="brown">Sure why not.</font>" His eyes lit up for a bit and then he left the table.</h4>

        <hr id=chaphr>
        <h4 style="color: darkkhaki">Classroom #troubleshooting 1:30PM</h4>

        <h4>Heading into my next class the teacher assigned us seats and I was assigned to sit down with a new student. My friend from way back texted me saying "You're going to love this dude."</h4>
        <h4>I was confused of what he's saying but, the teacher said to the class to look at the front because the new student is coming in... The guy ran in and I couldn't believe my eyes...</h4>
        <h4>My very first friend from my childhood
            <font color="skyblue">Kacklappen</font>. He introduced himself to the class and started to boldly walk to my desk where he and I were assigned to.</h4>
        <h4>
            "<font color="brown">Long time no see, dude! Why didn't you tell me you were moving back here?</font>", I said, 
            "<font color="skyblue">I wanted it to be a surprise man! I've missed you so much after all these years.</font>", he replied.</h4>
        <h4>
            "<font color="brown">Hey, I'm actually going to an arcade with another friend of mine after school. Do you want to tag along with me?</font>" 
            "<font color="skyblue">Sure! why not!.</font>" I had a huge smile on my face and then the class started afterward
