            <h4 style="color: fuchsia">Nurse office 12:55PM</h4>
            <h4>I woke up with a terrible headache and while still fatigued I think I'm in the nurse's office... "<font color="fuchsia">You gave everyone a scare when you passed out there, 
                <font color="brown">Butler</font></font>" Still fatigued; I couldnt really reply with anything other than a grunt.</h4>
            
            <h4> I fell back down onto the the hard bed with a slightly soft pillow and the nurse said, "<font color="fuchsia">Aww what a cute little sick thing you are</font>",
                which I thought was a little bit werid, but my headache was killing me to say anything</h4>
            
            <h4>* 2 hours later... * It was around when school was out when my friend, <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font>, walked up to my bed in the nurse office... 
                He's given me a weird look down upon me and said something that I couldn't hear...</h4>
            
            <h4>Vaguely, he keeled down to me looked at me and inspected to see if I was asleep. He took a big deep breath.
                Like a really. Really. Deep. Breath. Looked down again and started getting closer to my face...</h4>
            
            <h4>I was too fatigued to move or do anything at all to stop him from what hes going to do. I was sweating and frightened. 
                I only felt the tip of somewhat felt like a lip touching my lips but I soon fainted from the anxiety.</h4>
            
            <hr id="chaphr">
            <h4 style="color: darkorange">Butlers home 3:15PM</h4>
            <h4>A suprise wake up in my bed. I soon realize I'm at my house and not at the nurse's office anymore. I thought maybe it was just a dream of some sort; 
                that <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> came into my bed area and kissed me...</h4>
            <h4>It had to be a dream and not a reality, I made sure it was by texting <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> to see what really happened when he came into the nurse's office... *a few moments later* 
                "<font color="darkviolet">Open your door... I need to talk with you...</font>"</h4>
            <h4>I was shaking with fear. I kept asking my self. How did he find my house? Why would he say this? Is he up to something no good??? 
                After a good 5 minutes I slowly walked downstairs and noticed something...</h4>
            <h4>It was <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> waiting outside my front door... I thought to myself on what was going to happen when I open the door. 
                He rung the doorbell 5 times and shouted "<font color="darkviolet">I know you're home <font color="brown">butler!</font> Open this door now!</font></h4>
            <h4>Struck with fear I slowly approach the door... My hands are shaking while I reach for the door knob... Heart is pounding 999bpm... 
                I slowly turn the door handle... It's now unlocked but.</h4>
            <h4><font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> isn't paying any attention anymore... I slowly creek open the door and <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> pounces on me without me realizing it.</h4>
            <h4>"<font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font><font color="brown">! What the hell are you doing!</font>",
                as I scream and shouted for <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> to get off of me. He wouldn't listen and just started to tear apart my clothes revealing my skinny yet flabby body.</h4>
            <h4>I tried to shove him away but he just out matches me in strength and he's a lot heavier than me too... I grew tired trying to struggle out of his grasp of me.</h4>
            <h4> He's all out of breath too but it seems he's not going to back down after all of this effort...</h4>
                <h4><font color="darkviolet">I've waited... *deep breath* For this... *deep breath* Moment...
                    *deep breath* That... *deep breath* We... *deep breath* Can take our... Friendship... *deep breath* To the next... *deep breath* Level....</font></h4>
            <h4>After his speech he proceeded to pull out to what appears to be extasy and forced it into my mouth... It hit me almost instantly and everything... Started to feel... Good...</h4>
            <h4><font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> Started to take off his pants and removed his underwear to show his lanky, but long penis. 
                He pulled my head closer to it and my instincts from the extasy were to suck it</h4>
            <h4>He was moaning and just after 3 minutes of me sucking his penis. He came in my mouth. A big load came out and after that he pushed me down to the ground leaving my ass out in the open.</h4>
            <h4>he took out some pocket lube and a condom and spread my ass wide open and started to insert his penis in... 
                It hurt at first since It was my first time. But as time went on it was starting to feel a little bit good</h4>
            <h4>the extasy, his penis in my ass, and while he was stroking my penis was going to make me cum too. 
                <font color="darkviolet">I.. I'm going to cum, <font color="brown">Butler</font>!</font> I was going to cum too but I was too drugged up to say anything and kept on moaning.</h4>
            <h4>A few more strokes he came in my ass and after that. He started to bend over and let me fuck his ass too... I obliged and put on a condom and used some lube to then insert my penis into his asshole</h4>
            <h4>It was hard to insert it in at first, but i pused harder and my penis just slipped in. <font color="darkviolet">Ser.net</font> screamed with a moan afterwards. I started to thrust faster and faster until after just 10 strokes in. I came inside his asshole...</h4>
